This project is a proxy application that forwards requests to an ARGO API and optionally converts the responses to be compatible with OpenAI's API format. It can be used in conjunction with [autossh-tunnel-dockerized](https://github.com/Oaklight/autossh-tunnel-dockerized) or other secure connection tools.

## TL;DR

```bash
pip install argo-proxy # install the package
argo-proxy # run the proxy
```

Function calling is available for Chat Completions endpoint starting from `v2.7.5`. Try with `pip install "argo-proxy>=2.7.5"`
